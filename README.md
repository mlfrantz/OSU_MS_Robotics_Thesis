MIP research

This code base is used for applying Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) to an informative path planning problem for a heterogeneous group of autonomous ocean going vessels.

The main script that controls everything is the /src/mip_test.py which is run from the terminal.
Examples of how to run this script can be found in /scripts.
