Test I want to run
what constraints I want (4 or 5)?
	Directionality constraints
	Forced curl constraints
	Straight Line contraints
	Not going over the same spot twice
	Heterogenous teams of robots with different velocities
	
	Need to implement:
		Sychronization Constraint
		Obstacle avoidance?
		

What enviroments do I want to test in?
	Some systematic events?
		fake symettries? make sure it behaves systematically?
			It should but easy to check

	ROMS data: Working but need to fix scaling everything by the map resolution,
		Currently inputting via an array position, should change to x,y or lat,lon position

	Could possibly look at time varying envornments?
	

Which comparisons do I want to do?
	Other algorithms?
		RIG?
		Greedy?
	MCTS graph search?
	Other graph search algorithms?

Outline for my report
	What do I want to include
		Background
		Basic Structure
		My contraints
		Comparisons? :
		Time requirements
			Budget growth for single robot
			Number of constraints for fixed budget
			adding more robots
			

	What is in/out of scope?
		Heterogenous teams possibly out of scope but interesting

		

Timeline 

April: 	Init Gurobi: Done
		Lit Review: Kind of done, need more
May:	Implement one constraint in ROMS
			Kind of done, need to fix scaling issues
June:	Additional Constraints
July:	Computation/perfomance trials complete
Aug:	Presentation/writeup, final simulations
Sept:	Defend
			Julie rogered up, no dates yet, should be
			Tumar: no reply as of 27 June
